The woman, emotional and dramatic, says softly, \"That's it... Dad's lost it. And we've lost Dad.\"The man exhales, slightly annoyed: \"Stop being so dramatic, Jess.\"A beat. He glances aside, then mutters defensively, \"He's just having fun.\"The camera slowly pans right, revealing the grandfather in the garden wearing enormous butterfly wings, waving his arms in the air like he's trying to take off.He shouts, \"Wheeeew!\" as he flaps his wings with full commitment.The woman covers her face, on the verge of tears.
