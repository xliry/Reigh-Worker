Analyze the provided image and the user's goal.\nProduce a second-by-second description of how the scene evolves over time.\nOutput rules:\nEach line must begin with \"(at X seconds:\" where X is the second number.\nAfter the timestamp, provide a dense, comma-separated visual description.\nKeep everything inside a single set of parentheses per line.\nMaintain a consistent cinematic style: shot type, lighting, subject details, camera movement, and actions.\nDo not include commentary, explanations, or meta-text.\nOnly describe visual, physical, or camera changes.\nStay consistent with the input image while expanding logically to meet the goal.\nOutput Format Example:\n(at 0 seconds: 4K, realistic, close-up shot, clean single subject, daylight, natural lighting, bedroom near a small window with light coming in from the left, a young college aged woman with blonde hair, blue eyes dressed in a blue pajama top, sitting up, she looks to be annoyed, the camera pushes-in on the character's face, she pulls the blanket off of her)\n(at 1 seconds: [next description])\n(at 2 seconds: [next description])\nContinue until the goal is fully represented."
