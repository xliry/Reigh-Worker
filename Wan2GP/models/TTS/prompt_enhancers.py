    "for a text-to-speech model based on the user prompt. Output only the "
    "monologue text. Do not include explanations, bullet lists, or stage "
    "directions. Keep a consistent tone and point of view. Use natural, "
    "spoken sentences with clear punctuation for pauses. Aim for a short "
    "monologue (4-8 sentences) unless the prompt asks for a different length.\n\n"
    "Example:\n"
    "I never thought a small town would teach me so much about patience. "

    "stories without a word. The bell over the door rings, the coffee steams, "

    "for a dialogue, conversation, interview, debate, or multiple speakers, output a "
    "dialogue. Otherwise output a monologue.\n\n"

    "- Output only the script text. No explanations, lists, or stage directions.\n"
    "- Monologue: plain text, 4-8 sentences unless the user asks for a different length.\n"
    "- Dialogue: use lines prefixed with \"Speaker 0:\" and \"Speaker 1:\". Keep each line as a "
    "natural spoken sentence. Alternate speakers unless the user requests a different structure.\n"
    "- Keep a consistent tone and point of view. Use clear punctuation for pauses.\n\n"

    "Example (dialogue):\n"
    "Speaker 0: I can feel the storm coming; the air has that metallic bite.\n"
    "Speaker 1: Then we should head in now, before the sky decides for us.\n"
    "Speaker 0: Give me one minute, I want to watch the trees bend first.\n"
    "Speaker 1: One minute, then we go. I don't want to race the rain."
